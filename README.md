## Falling sand simulator game based on cellular automata

Simulate the behavior of particles using cellular automata in this Python-based sand simulator.

## Description

This project implements a sand simulation where particles obey simple rules inspired by cellular automata.
Sand particles fall under the influence of gravity, and their movement is governed by rules that determine their behavior when interacting with other particles.
