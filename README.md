## Falling sand simulator game based on cellular automata

Simulate the behavior of particles using cellular automata in this Python-based sand simulator.

## Description

This project implements a sand simulation where particles obey simple rules inspired by cellular automata.
Sand particles fall under the influence of gravity, and their movement is governed by rules that determine their behavior when interacting with other particles.  

## Implemented:      
-> Sand particles

## Future Implementations:  
-> Water    
-> Lava   
-> Vapor (Created by the interaction between water and lava)  

## What is a cellular automata?

A cellular automaton (CA) is a discrete mathematical model that consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states. The cells evolve over discrete time steps based on a set of predefined rules that determine the state of each cell in the next iteration. The rules typically depend on the current state of a cell and its neighboring cells.

The grid, often represented as a lattice, can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or even higher-dimensional. Each cell interacts with its neighbors according to the specified rules, and these interactions lead to the evolution of the entire system over time.

Cellular automata are used in various fields, including computer science, physics, biology, and artificial life. They were first introduced by mathematician John von Neumann and later popularized by cellular automaton pioneer Stephen Wolfram. Cellular automata can exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior, and they have been used to study emergent phenomena and simulate diverse processes in different scientific and computational contexts. Wolfram's Rule 30 is a famous example of a one-dimensional cellular automaton that produces complex and seemingly random patterns from simple rules.
